These scripts allow building a rudimentary package containing all the
plain packages needed to install VMN. It assumes that the directories
are side-by-side with this directory and should be called from the
parent directory.

The rudimentary allows installing all packages with single command and
is documented by a README file of its own. Thus, this package can be
used to distribute the software in a platform independent conservative
way or be used as instruction for how to set up a package for any
given distribution.
