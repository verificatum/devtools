# Verificatum Build Scripts

These scripts allow building a rudimentary package containing all the
plain packages needed to install VMN. It assumes that the directories
are side-by-side with this directory and should be called from the
parent directory.

This allows installing all packages with single command and is
documented by a `README.md` file of its own. Thus, this package can be
used to distribute the software in a platform independent conservative
way for demonstration purposes or be used as instruction for how to
set up a package for any given distribution.
